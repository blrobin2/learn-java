# Packages
* Over 8 million Java developers worldwide
* Class or interface name conflicts are inevitable
* Mechanism is needed to fully specify class
* Allow use of classes with the same name in the same project (or, even, the class)

## Some reason to use packages are:
* Programmers can easily determine that the classes are related
* It is easy to know where to find the classes and interfaces that can provide the functions provided by the package
* Because the package creates a new namespace, class and interface name conflicts are avoided
* Classes within the package can have unrestricted access to one another while still restricting access for classes outside the package
